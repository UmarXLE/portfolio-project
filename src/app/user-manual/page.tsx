                <ul className={styled.content_text_ul}>
                    <li> <span>Cross-functional</span>: I‚Äôm a generalist at heart and enjoy projects that utilize a broad set of skills across product, data, and growth.</li>
                    <li> <span>Systems thinking</span>: I reduce complexity into systems in order to better understand. I love thinking deeply about interesting problems.</li>
                    <li><span>Moving fast</span>: I get frustrated when I‚Äôm not producing frequent output and therefore I like to iterate at a pretty quick pace.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div className={styled.content_text_item}>
                <h3 className={styled.sub_title}>üëéüèºWEAKNESSES</h3>
                <ul className={styled.content_text_ul}>
                    <li><span>Operating without context</span>: I struggle contributing to decisions where I don‚Äôt have sufficient context or background.</li>
                    <li><span>Starting simple</span>: My brain will skip baseline approaches and try to do too much, too fast. Don't be afraid to rein me in.</li>
                    <li><span>Overextending myself</span>: I get excited by lots of things and sometimes (okay, all the time) that means I spread myself too thin.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div className={styled.content_text_item}>
                <h3 className={styled.sub_title}>üõ† PRINCIPLES </h3>
                <ul className={styled.content_text_ul}>
                    <li><span>Bias towards action</span>: Getting started is the best way to begin making progress and start learning. Avoid unchecked inaction.</li>
                    <li><span>Growth mindset</span>: I‚Äôm constantly challenging myself to improve. When I get too comfortable, my work and happiness suffer.</li>
                    <li><span>Bigger bets</span>: We should be willing to pass on small opportunities in order to focus on potential step changes.</li>
                    <li><span>Time for thought</span>: I block off time to explore ideas that might not relate to current projects. Without this time, I feel like a machine.</li>
                    <li><span>Keep it simple</span>: Sometimes we have to go into the weeds, but it shouldn't be the default. If it's not the focus, keep it simple. </li>
                    <li><span>Opinions are useful</span>: Both people and products should be opinionated. Taking a stance helps move the conversation forward.</li>
                    <li><span>Learning in public</span>: I'm happier when I'm sharing things that I find helpful. This often means a steady drip of blog posts.</li>
                </ul>
